# GenAI-model-using-cohere
This project involves building a Generative AI (GenAI) model using Cohere's R+ model architecture to generate natural, human-like text for a variety of applications. The project aims to leverage the capabilities of the Cohere R+ model,  designed to provide high-quality, context-aware language generation and understanding across multiple domains.
